# Algo Mock

As part of the hackathon, my responsibility as a front-end developer was to create a platform interface for conducting algorithmic interviews. Together with the backend developer, we **effectively** completed the task, developing a working prototype of the application in the shortest possible time.

## Results

- Experience working in a team with a backend developer, prompt engineer, designer and product manager at all stages of product creation.
- **Successfully** completed duties. My colleagues **assessed** my work **positively**.
- **Effective** work under limited time and tight deadlines.

These moments represent not only technological progress, but also valuable experience in teamwork and **effective** time management in an environment with limited resources.
